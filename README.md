# Zoom Analog Clock

A clock for the *Flutter Clock* contest.
It represents a zoomed analog clock, centered on the dots representing the outer circle of it.
The clock consists in a single orange hand that shows the current time, based on hours, minutes and
seconds.
By a series of rotations, translations and scales, the single hand seems to turn around the center
of the screen, creating a hypnotical effect.
It comes with two themes : light and dark. The them changes with respect to the current brightness.
